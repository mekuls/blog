Welcome to the website where I keep my notes.

After a few years of hacking (*in the old sense of the word*), I realized that I was horrible at keeping track of old knowledge and constantly repeating myself when solving similar problems. I created this website in order to keep track of things I'd done in the past, and to perhaps give insight to others that might stumble across these pages.

## A few quick disclaimers:
Use the information on this site at your own risk. Always conduct your own research and due diligence before trying anything you find here. As a rule, **I don't trust me, so neither should you*.*

* If you see something and you're not sure what it does, **don't run it**. 
* If you see something related to reverse engineering or code injection **proceed with caution**. 
* If you see something that should be ammended or could be done better, feel free to email me.


All that aside, I hope I can help :)
